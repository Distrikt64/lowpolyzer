# Lowpolyzer
A Blender addon to add low poly style to your meshes

## Install
1. Create a zip of the lowpolyzer directory
2. In Blender, install the zipped addon in the preferences window

## How does it work?
This addon adds 2 modifiers for each object you have selected:
- Remesh modifier
- Decimate modifier

The remesh modifier is used to create one whole object, 
while the decimate modifier will reduce significantly the geometry detail.
